# Rails base skeleton application

This project is a boilerplate application for any new rails project you may start.

When you clone, you need to change the application name to the name of the project in the following files:
  1. config/application.rb
  2. config/database.yml
  3. config/initializers/session_store.rb
  4. This one of course! (README.md)

## Work In Progress!
